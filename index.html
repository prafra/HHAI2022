                    In April 2021, the EU Parliament published a proposal, the AI Act (AIA), for regulating the use of
                    AI systems
                    and services in the Union market. However, the effects of EU digital regulations usually transcend
                    its
                    confines. An example of what has been named the "Brussel effect" - the high impact of EU digital
                    regulations
                    around the world - is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in May
                    2018 and
                    rapidly became a world standard. The AIA seems to go in the same direction, having a clear
                    extraterritorial
                    scope, in that it applies to any AI system or service that has an impact on European Citizens,
                    regardless of
                    where its provider or user is located. The AIA adopts a risk-based approach that bans certain
                    technologies,
                    proposes strict regulations for "high risk" ones, and imposes stringent transparency criteria for
                    others. If
                    adopted, the AIA will undoubtedly have a significant impact in the EU and beyond. A crucial question
                    is
                    whether we already have the technology to comply with the proposed regulation and to what extent can
                    the
                    requirements of this regulation be enforceable.</p>

                <p>This workshop aims at analyzing how this new regulation will shape the AI technologies of the future,
                    collecting together input and discussions from multidisciplinar stakeholders.</p>

	<p>In April 2021, the EU Parliament published a proposal, the AI Act (AIA), for regulating the use of AI systems
            and services in the Union market. However, the effects of EU digital regulations usually transcend its
            confines. An example of what has been named the "Brussel effect" - the high impact of EU digital regulations
            around the world - is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in May 2018 and
            rapidly became a world standard. The AIA seems to go in the same direction, having a clear extraterritorial
            scope, in that it applies to any AI system or service that has an impact on European Citizens, regardless of

            proposes strict regulations for "high risk" ones, and imposes stringent transparency criteria for others. If

            whether we already have the technology to comply with the proposed regulation and to what extent can the
            requirements of this regulation be enforceable.</p>

        <p>This workshop aims at analyzing how this new regulation will shape the AI technologies of the future.</p>-->

        <p>Do we already have the technology to comply with the proposed regulation? How to operationalize the privacy,
            fairness, and explainability requirements of the AI Act? To what extent does the AI act protect individual
            rights? How can redress be accomplished? What are the best methods to perform a risk assessment of AI
            applications? Do we need to define new metrics for validating the goodness of an AI system in terms of
            privacy, fairness, and explainability? What methods to assess the quality of the datasets need to be created
            to be compliant with the current proposal for the AI regulation? How is it possible to deliver a process
            that effectively certificates AI? How will the proposed AI Act impact non-EU tech companies operating in the
            EU? Will this make the EU the leader of AI market regulation?</p>

        <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The AI Act and future technologies</li>
            <li>Applications of AI in the legal domain</li>

                <h5>Type of contributions of interest</h5>
                <p>We encourage authors to submit both research papers and position papers. Research papers present
                    completed and validated research, whereas position papers present an arguable opinion about one of
                    the workshop topics of interest. Both types of contribution can be of regular (12–15+ pages) or
                    short length (6-8+ pages) and should be original, previously unpublished work. </p>

                <p>We also encourage authors to submit extended abstracts that present a very early stage of research or
                    previously published work. This latter type of contributions will not be published in the
                    proceedings.</p>

                <h5>Page limits</h5>
                <p>The typical paper length for each type of contribution is described in the previous paragraph.
                    However, there is no strict rule regarding a maximum page limit, authors are encouraged to submit a
                    paper of length proportional to its contribution.</p>

                <h5>Review format</h5>
                <p>All submitted papers will be peer reviewed using double-blind peer review. We accept both LaTeX and
                    Word files
                    formatted according to

                <p>Please ensure that your submission is anonymous. Authors are expected to remove author and
                    institutional identities from the title and header areas of the paper. Authors should also remove
                    any information in the acknowledgements section that reveals authors or the institution. Finally,
                    authors are required to cite their own work in the third person. Note: Papers that violate the
                    anonymization policy will be desk rejected.</p>


                <h5> Publication venue</h5>
                <p>Papers will be published as workshop proceedings, several venues are being considered, further
                    details will be soon published.</p>
